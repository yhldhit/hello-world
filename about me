Hello! It is happy to introduce myself in Git.
My name is Trait. Now I am a PHD student in HIT. My major is computer science and this is my first year 
in computation perception and machine learning centre. Now my labmates and me works on computer vision and machine learning, which
we are interested in. Now I mainly focus on the optimization of algorithm and try to have deeper insight into the structure
of the deep and shallow model, which are two main tools in our field. There are many works published on this topic, however they
are far from enough. Deep models are expected to wildlier applied, not being limited by its efficiency. If we can make a move forward along 
this road, we are expected make some changes in our daily life.
Thanks for your time.
